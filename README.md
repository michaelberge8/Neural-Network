# Neural-Network
This is a neural network which solves the XOR problem which requires a multi-layer percepetron to solve. The perceptron is trained over a number of iterations defined by the user (epoch). The improvement of the network is graphed over the iterations and displayed. A visualization of the improvment of the network is also displayed.
