# Multilayer Perceptron (1 hidden layer)
This is a multilayer neural network (with 1 hidden layer) which solves the XOR problem. The perceptron is trained over a number of iterations defined by the user (epoch). The improvement of the network is graphed over the iterations and displayed. A visualization of the improvment of the network is also displayed during runtime.
